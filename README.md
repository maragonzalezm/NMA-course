This code was written by Mara Gonzalez for a small Computational Neuroscience course project. 
The objective of this code is to calculate the mean brain activity per brain region, 
and compare it to other regions in order to discover which brain refgions are more active before and after a task is being made.

The Steinmetz et al. (2019) dataset was used for this project and can be found here:
